FPS matters more and more with increasing FPS
Weird stuff under 10fps
size 1 = data corruption
cargo build --release
720p had less crunchy sound, what about 144p ?

WHAT TO DO ON THE ISG:
Optimize:
    Find a tool for optimization
    GET RID OF THAT FUCKING CLONE (Doesn't matter much)
    Multithreading (thread # agnostic)
Fix the weird bug
    Make blocks start from top right corner (Gives me even sizes)
    make it so differentiates between regular, 16:9 size and actual size
    Embedding or reading an imperfect causes bugs
    Not sure if a problem of embedding or reading
    Might be get_pixel
    It's not overlapping, I'm sure
    I noticed that every second frame seems broken
    It stops me from using anything other than 360p/720p
    Might have something built in
    Might be the length of file written in instructions
Test more b/w formats
    What leads to max compression resistance and min runtime
    See if lower resolution changes anything
u32 instructions
    Might still be not enough, idk
    Used for end-of-file pointers
    Convert every instruction to u32

Use branches
